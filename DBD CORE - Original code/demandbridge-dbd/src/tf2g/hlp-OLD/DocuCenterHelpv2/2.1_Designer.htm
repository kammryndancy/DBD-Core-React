<h1>2.1 Designer</h1>
<p class="Normal">The Designer is responsible for creating the documents and
content. Once all the documents are ready on the Designer’s workstation, the
Designer has to add a new Item to the DocuCenter catalog.</p>

<p class="Normal">The Designer creates a new item and adds it to the above
catalog view. The item is literally built up piecemeal, line by line, each line
describing one step of how the item is supposed to be printed or created by the
Manufacturer eventually. This process is made easy with the GUI provided in
DocuCenter. A view of this process is shown below.</p>

<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Normal">Each line can be associated with a file containing relevant
content. This file can be attached to the right line using the <i>Upload Artwork</i> link provided. This file
is delivered to the Manufacturer for production down the line when this item is
ordered by any Customer. The Designer submits the item to the Manager after the
build process is completed. Along with the item submission, at this time, the
Designer may ask for a proof of the item to be created by the Manufacturer. The
Designer also has the option to save the item for some time and return to it
for more work if required. In this case, the item will not be open to access by
other Designers or users.</p>
