                    <td style="font-size: 8pt;text-align: justify;">Matching is one of the Generally Accepted Accounting Principals.  This means that you should post costs of sales in the same period in which you recognize revenue.  When you receive vendor invoices, DB Distributor will post the cost to a Work in Progress general ledger account.  At the time you invoice your customer, this accrual will be reversed against a posting to cost of sales.  Normally you will leave this box unchecked as you would only want to make a posting to Work in progress upon receipt of a vendor invoice that was the result of a purchase order.  However, some customers may choose to accrue work in progress for internally generated costs.  Checking this box will provide for work in progress entries for special charges that are not included on purchase orders.</td>

                    <td style="font-size: 8pt;text-align: justify;">If your commission calculations change based upon the product that is sold, you have two options.  One is strictly to default commission codes based upon the product code and the other defaults commission codes by a combination of the Salesperson and the Product Code. This later method is triggered by checking this box.  In doing this you can put in place plans that default commission by product code but that also vary from one salesperson to another.</td>
